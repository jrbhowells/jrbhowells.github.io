                    <h2>Christmas in a Box PSS</h2>
                    <p>Part of a sustainable design module for my degree, I worked in a group to create a product-service system focused on delivering a more sustainable Christmas at a lower price than existing options. More detail coming soon.</p>

                    <h2>RevEng: Reverse Engineering</h2>
                    <img src="img/portfolio/pmat/rev-teardown.png">
                    <p>A deliverable for a Production and Materials module, I tore down a cheap trim router, analysing its components, material make-up and manufacturing processes, before making recommendations for its improvement. For the project, I created a full bill of materials for the router, and analysed the embodied energy of each component, and concluded that the greatest saving from an embodied energy point of view was to be made by changing the material of the main housing from steel to PA6-GF30.</p>

                    <p>Another deliverable for the above Production and Materials module, I was asked to provide a material recommendation for an 'elegant pair of scissors.' I based my selection on the materials available in Granta's EduPack software. This was the first deliverable of the degree, so there are many things I would now do differently (though the report did still get a First).</p>

                    <h2>Carbon-neutral Housing Study</h2>
                    <p>Part of a thermofluids module, I analysed a typical rural bungalow's energy needs, and came up with several interventions to improve its energy performance. These ranged from better insulation to harnessing hydroelectricity and heat pumps. My report was used as an example report for teaching the module the next year, but as the house in question is my own and the report includes images and renders, I am not making it available here.</p>

                    <p>A study involving designing a car in SolidWorks and analysing its aerodynamic performance. I sketched a concept from four elevations (front, back, side, top) before importing these into SolidWorks and using projected sketches to create a 3D object. This could then be analysed using CFD techniques.</p>
