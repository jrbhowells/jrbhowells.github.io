<h2>Vehicle Aerodynamics Simulation</h2>
<img src="img/portfolio/cfd/cfd-cut-velocity.png">
<p>A study involving designing a car in SolidWorks and analysing its aerodynamic performance. I sketched a concept from four elevations (front, back, side, top) before importing these into SolidWorks and using projected sketches to create a 3D object. This could then be analysed using CFD techniques.</p>
