<h2>Coffee Table</h2>
<img src="img/portfolio/table/table-3.JPG" style="width: 100%;">
<p>Part of my A-level course, I made this coffee table in walnut and ash, with a tempered glass top. The joinery was by far the most complex task: the bottom of each leg features a hybrid mitre/bridle joint, and the tabletop itself is joined using a mitre joint with ash keys. All joinery had to be cut by hand due to tool-use restrictions.</p>
