<h2>Fully Sustainable Eco-Home</h2>
<img src="img/portfolio/c3p/c3p-tile.png">
<p>Part of my Pre-U in Art & Design (DT), this was a project I'd wanted to do for a long time. I analysed the exact needs of a 2-bedroom home and devised ways of providing all of this in a fully-sustainable way, with no reliance on external utilities. In addition to this, I designed and rendered the home and produced a specification for its construction.</p>
