<h2>RevEng: Reverse Engineering</h2>
<img src="img/portfolio/pmat/rev-teardown.png">
<p>A deliverable for a Production and Materials module, I tore down a cheap trim router, analysing its components, material make-up and manufacturing processes, before making recommendations for its improvement. For the project, I created a full bill of materials for the router, and analysed the embodied energy of each component, and concluded that the greatest saving from an embodied energy point of view was to be made by changing the material of the main housing from steel to PA6-GF30.</p>
