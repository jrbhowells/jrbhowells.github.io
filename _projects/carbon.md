<h2>Carbon-neutral Housing Study</h2>
<p>Part of a thermofluids module, I analysed a typical rural bungalow's energy needs, and came up with several interventions to improve its energy performance. These ranged from better insulation to harnessing hydroelectricity and heat pumps. My report was used as an example report for teaching the module the next year, but as the house in question is my home and the report includes images and renders, I am not making it available here.</p>
