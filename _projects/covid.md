<h2>Coronavirus Data Scraper</h2>
<p>In early February 2020, 2019-nCoV (now called COVID-19) was spreading rapidly. Accurate data were hard to find at the time, so I decided to create an extremely simple scraping program in Python to log current COVID cases, hospitalisations and deaths.</p>

<p>The program ran for three years (until I stopped it), saving data to an Excel spreadsheet. Far more accurate data are now available, but I maintained the program and kept it running for interest. The above graph shows cases, hospitalisatons and deaths over time, and the CFR (case fatality rate, reported deaths per reported case) is below. The large gap between days ~640 and ~760 are where I lost data to a faulty SSD.</p>
