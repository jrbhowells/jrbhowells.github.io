<h2>CareWare: Space Saving in Small Kitchens</h2>
<img src="img/portfolio/careware/careware-tile.png">
<p>A design project forming part of my degree, I worked in a group to create a human-centred, space-saving device for small kitchens. The final product was a multipurpose sink cover, which allowed the sink to be used as extra counter space or a chopping board - or could be rotated through 140 degrees to become a drying rack beside the sink.</p>
