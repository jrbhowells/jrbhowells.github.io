<h2>Calendar / Reminders Webapp</h2>
<p>
    A complete HTML, CSS and JavaScript webapp for organising tasks in a calendar format. This
    project was for a computing module I took as part of my degree, and used an neDB database
    to store information. Meshing a computer's idealised vision of time with a calendar (e.g.
    accounting for leap years) proved to be the most challenging part.
