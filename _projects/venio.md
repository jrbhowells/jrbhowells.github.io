<p>Venio is a tool to help new and inexperienced cyclists navigate in a city, with built-in GPS and haptic feedback to guide users. We developed all aspects of the product, including branding, packaging, compliance and labelling, as well as producing a fully working prototype and a set of technical drawings for production.</p>
