<h2>This Website</h2>
<p>
    This website is my own creation. I built it using HTML and CSS, with JavaScript for
    interactive elements, and it is made available through GitHub Pages with Jekyll. Because I've coded it
    from scratch, with no frameworks, there may be some compatibility issues with some browsers
    etc. - if you find any, please let me know! I have some experience with JavaScript and PHP,
    as well as (very limited) knowledge of Flask and Django, although as there is no backend on
    this site I haven't used either of these.
