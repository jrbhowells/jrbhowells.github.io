<h2>Recycled Teak Garden Bench</h2>
<p>My iGCSE Resistant Materials (DT) coursework, this bench was made from fully recycled teak: the boards had been used for flooring. They were quite thin so needed laminating together into beams. Overall it was a fun project and I was really happy with the result.</p>
