    <h2>About the Project</h2>
    <p>Oculate is a set of two products to help cyclists find their way around urban streets. It was designed for the first part of an industrial design engineering module - continued development of this concept led to Garmin Venio</p>
    <h3>The Product</h3>
    <p>For new cyclists, navigating city streets can be hard. Oculate provides a wearable that protects a user's eyes and provides route guidance and hazard warnings. The separate handlebar console can provide route information should the glasses run out of power, and allows the user to control magnetically-attached indicators at the ends of the handlebars.</p>
    <h3>Glasses</h3>
    <p>The glasses use clear LCD displays to show route information to the user, and also feature built-in vibration motors above the ears to warn of approaching hazards. Electronics are housed in small casings below the arms of the glasses: these were prototyped for size and location, and this was found to be least obtrusive.</p>

    <h3>Indicators</h3>
    <p>Two consoles, one for each side, are attached to the handlebars. These are used to control the handlebar-tip indicators, and one of the two has a small screen displaying simple navigation instructions. The indicators themselves attach magnetically, and have the option of charging through a dynamo attached to the bike. Proximity sensors, to detect incoming traffic, are mounted to the indicators.</p>
