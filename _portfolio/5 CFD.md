    <h2>About the Project</h2>
    <p>In this project, I used surface modelling techniques in SolidWorks to build a Lamborghini-inspired car of my own design. I then analysed its aerodynamic performance using SolidWorks simulation, before proposing modifications to the design to reduce drag coefficient.</p>
    <h3>The Design</h3>
    <img src="img/portfolio/cfd/cfd-sketch.png" style="width: 50%;">
    <p>I modelled the basic shape of my car on the Lamborghini Huracan, designing my own panels and exterior features. I drew detailed sketches of the car from the front, bact, top and side before importing these into SolidWorks to trace from. Because I had made the sketches by hand, there were some inconsistencies I had to account for in the design.</p>
    <h3>Analysis</h3>

    <p>I set the wind speed to 31.3 m/s (70 mph) and made sure gravity was turned on for the simulation. I analysed pressure and velocity of air along the car using cut plots, and used surface pressure distributions to identify problem areas. In addition, I used flow trajectories to locate turbulent flow around the vehicle. The coefficient of drag was a relatively high 0.45, probably due to the high frontal area of the design.</p>
    <h3>Next Steps</h3>

    <p>Within the scope of the project, I did not have to make and test a second iteration - however, I did sketch some modifications to improve the aerodynamic performance of my car. These centred around reducing pressure concentrators and vortices created by the sharp rear of the design.</p>
