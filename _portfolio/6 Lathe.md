    <h2>About the Project</h2>
    <p>I started designing the wood lathe in year nine, and it was my first experience of using CAD to design a product specifically for manufacture. I re-used the motor from an e-scooter, but built every other part of the lathe - including the power supply and custom four-jaw chuck - from scratch.</p>

    <h3>Manufacture</h3>
    <p>After lots of testing, building the lathe allowed me to develop my knowledge of workshops and manufacturing processes such as welding, casting, turning and milling. I fitted the build in between other projects and coursework, and I was able to submit part of the work I did for my Design Technology Pre-U qualification. This and other projects also won me the school design technology prize.</p>
