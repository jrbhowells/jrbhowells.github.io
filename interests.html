            <h3>Sailing</h3>
            <p>I have been sailing for many years, both on small catamarans and on larger monohulls.
                I am especially experienced on metre-rule-style boats, though from an obscure European
                class.
            </p>
            <p>I am accredited up to the Hungarian Sailing Association's highest level of youth
                qualification (including race qualification), MVSz III
            </p>
            <h3>Outdoors</h3>
            <p>
                Having done both Silver and Gold DofE, and living rurally, I enjoy spending time
                outdoors. I regularly go on hiking trips around the UK and Europe and an an active
                member of my university Outdoor Society.
